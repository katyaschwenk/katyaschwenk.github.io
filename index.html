<h1>Katya Schwenk</h1>
<p>I’m a journalist based in Brooklyn. I’m currently a staff reporter at The Lever, an investigative news outlet, where among other things, I cover the corruption and profiteering in our courts and the criminal legal system. My work has been published in Rolling Stone, The Intercept, The Baffler, Jacobin, the American Prospect, Business Insider, and elsewhere. </p>
  <p> Before my job at The Lever, I was an alt-weekly writer in Phoenix, where I covered cops and prosecutors in the desert.</p></div>
